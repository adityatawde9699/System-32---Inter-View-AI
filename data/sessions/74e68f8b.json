      "question": "Could you tell me more about the modular architecture you implemented for your Personal AI Voice Assistant, \"Micky,\" and how that approach has helped you with feature expansion?",
      "answer": "recording  Mickey is a very good modular architecture. I am currently planning to use the post-grade SQLA net  I just planned Mickey to have a personal secretary assistant  I got inspired to build Mickey from a movie of Marvel named Iron Man  Created in 2008  When I saw Jarvis first, I was in love with it  That's all",
