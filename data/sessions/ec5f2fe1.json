        "improvement_tip": "The candidate needs to directly address the AgMarket Watch app and the process of gathering live seed and pulse prices for Maharashtra districts. The current answer describes a different app ('EG market') and a completely unrelated functionality (crop image analysis). They should thoroughly re-read the question and prepare an answer that specifically addresses the app and data gathering process mentioned.",
